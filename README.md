WPS is a geolocation system that uses the characteristics of nearby Wi-Fi hotspots and other wireless access points to discover where a device is located. It is used where satellite navigation such as GPS is inadequate due to various causes including multipath and signal blockage indoors, or where acquiring a satellite fix would take too long. Such systems include indoor positioning systems. Wi-Fi positioning takes advantage of the rapid growth in the early 21st century of wireless access points in urban areas.</br>
In this project, we use Arduino linefollower robot and ESP8266EX to meansure RSSI of 3 WiFis continuous. Then make a WiFi map to determine user position.</br>
